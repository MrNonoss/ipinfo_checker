# ipinfo_checker
A pretty simple bash script to query ipinfo.io<br>
<br>
With this script, you can query ipinfo.io in an easy way.
Two searches options are available:<br>
--> A short one, just to get the country code<br>
--> A long one, that looks also for the ISP, AS number and guess if it's a mobile IP address, based on AS number<br>
<br>
Be sure to add your api key as a variable in line 33.
You can get one (paid or free) from them.<br>
<br>
Usage: ./ipinfo_checker.sh entryfile outfile
