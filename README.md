# ipinfo_checker
A pretty simple bash script to query ipinfo.io

With this script, you can query ipinfo.io in an easy way.
Two searches options are available:
--> A short one, just to get the country code
--> A long one, that looks also for the ISP

Be sure to add your api key as a variable.
You can get one (paid or free) from them.

Thanks https://ipinfo.io fort his cool tool.
